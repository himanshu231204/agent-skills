# oss-ready

An AI skill that transforms any repository into a professional, contributor-friendly open source project. It analyzes your actual codebase and produces repository-specific artifacts — not generic templates.

## What It Does

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Repository Analysis | Detect language, framework, architecture, maturity, and readiness gaps |
| Documentation Generation | Create README, CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY, and all essential docs |
| GitHub Community | Issue templates, PR templates, CODEOWNERS, label strategy |
| Contribution Opportunities | Identify real, meaningful issues from code analysis |
| Architecture Mapping | Document structure, dependencies, and module relationships |
| CI/CD Workflows | Generate build, test, lint, and release pipelines |
| Developer Experience | Setup guides, coding standards, commit conventions |
| Release Management | Versioning strategy, changelogs, release checklists |
| Readiness Report | Scored assessment across six dimensions |

## Quick Start

```
Run oss-ready on this repository to make it contributor-ready.
```

### Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `oss-ready audit` | Analyze repository, produce readiness report (no file changes) |
| `oss-ready generate` | Create only the files that are missing |
| `oss-ready improve` | Enhance existing documentation in place |
| `oss-ready issues` | Identify real contribution opportunities from code analysis |
| `oss-ready full` | Audit, generate, issues, report — complete pipeline |

## How It Works

1. **Analyze** — Detect project type, languages, frameworks, tooling, and current open source readiness
2. **Score** — Rate six dimensions using weighted scoring
3. **Generate** — Create missing artifacts using templates and repository-specific content
4. **Report** — Produce a readiness report with scores, generated artifacts, and prioritized next steps

## Readiness Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | What It Checks |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| Documentation | 25% | README, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, SUPPORT, CHANGELOG, LICENSE |
| GitHub Community | 20% | Issue templates, PR template, CODEOWNERS, labels, discussions |
| CI/CD | 15% | Build, test, lint, and release workflows |
| Testing | 15% | Test framework, test files, CI integration, coverage |
| Developer Experience | 15% | Setup instructions, development guide, coding standards, commit conventions |
| Security | 10% | SECURITY.md, dependency scanning, secret scanning |

## Technology Support

## Safe Mode

This skill operates in safe mode by default:

- Never overwrites existing files unless explicitly requested
- Never generates placeholder content
- Never assumes technology without detection
- Always improves existing documentation when possible
- Always produces repository-specific output

## Agent Independence

Works with any AI coding agent that follows Markdown instructions:

- Claude Code / Opencode
- Cursor / Codex CLI
- Gemini CLI / Cline
- Aider / Continue

## Design Principles

1. **Single source of truth** — `reference.md` contains all detection tables, scoring methodology, and output formats. All other files reference it.
2. **Technology agnostic** — No assumptions about package managers, CI platforms, or languages. Everything is detected.
3. **Repository-specific** — Every generated artifact reflects the actual codebase, not generic templates.
4. **Safe by default** — Never overwrites existing files. Always explains what was generated and why.
5. **Modular** — Each agent has clear input/output contracts. No duplicated logic.
